OpenZWaveUtility
Commandline utility for use with the OpenZWave Library

This program provides a daemon that runs OpenZWave commands that it receives from client versions of the program.

Typically, you'll want to run ozw_utility -D to create the daemon, and then e.g. 
ozw_utility --node-number=1 --set-dimmer=99 
to turn the dimmer associated with node 1 all the way on.

ozw_utility -k will kill the daemon.


To compile:
1.  Install OpenZWave https://github.com/OpenZWave/open-zwave
2.  Copy ozw_config to the directory with the OpenZWaveUtility source files.
3.  make

The result is the binary file ozw_utility

IMPORTANT: The program expects a directory /run/ozw_utility/ so make sure that directory is created at boot or at least before you try to run the program.

ozw_utility -h
will show you all the available options.
